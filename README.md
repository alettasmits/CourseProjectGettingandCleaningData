##Purpose 
one R script called run_analysis.R that merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
It should:
* Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
