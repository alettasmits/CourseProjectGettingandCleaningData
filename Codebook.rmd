##THESE ARE THE VARIABLES
* fileURL: url of the file to be downloaded
* f: filepath
* train: filepath of the training files
* test: filepath of the test files
* subjectTraining: datafile (name refers to contents)
* subjectTest: datafile (name refers to contents)
* activityTraining: datafile (name refers to contents)
* activityTest: datafile (name refers to contents)
* labelsTraining: datafile (name refers to contents)
* labelsTest: datafile (name refers to contents)
* features: datafile (name refers to contents)
* activityTotal: combined file of activityTraining and activityTest
* subjectTotal: combined file of subjectTraining and subjectTest
* labelsTotal: combined file of labelsTraining and labelsTest
* nearlyDone: columns of the three TOTAL files combined
* subSetNames: the set of columnnames that I want included in my final dataset from labelsTotal
* desiredColumnNames: the set of column names from labelsTotal including 'subject' and 'activity'
* FinalSet: The final dataset with all the desired columns
* FinalSetfinally; the Final set with all the means calculated

##MAKE SURE DPLYR IS ACTIVE
library(dplyr)

##FOR DOWNLOADING THE FILE
* set the URL from which to download the file
* check if there is a folder 'data'
* if not create one
* get a value for f, the file.path: the folder in which you are working now+/data+nameOftheFile
* download the file from the URL and save it at the location referred to by f

fileURL <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip"

if(!file.exists("./data")){dir.create("./data")}

f <- file.path(getwd(),"/data", "Dataset.zip")

download.file(fileURL, f)

##UNZIP THE FILE
* The file will generate a folder named "UCI HAR Dataset"
* Get the list of files in that folder

unzip(zipfile="./data/Dataset.zip", exdir="./data/unzipped")

##GET THE FILENAMES AND READ THE RELEVANT FILES
* README.txt gives information on the files that we need:
* traininginformation is in the file: train/X_train.txt
* testinformation is in the file: test/X_test.txt 
* labels for both sets are in: train/y_train.txt and test/y_test.txt
* train/subject_train.txt and test/subject_test.txt
* all the names of the variables are in features.txt
* opening in txt yields weird signs so lets see what happens if we read them via R and make them into a table
* Read the relevant files and first set a variable for the path

train <- "./data/unzipped/UCI HAR Dataset/train"

test <- "./data/unzipped/UCI HAR Dataset/test"

subjectTraining <- read.table(file.path(train, "subject_train.txt"))

subjectTest <- read.table(file.path(test, "subject_test.txt"))

activityTest <- read.table(file.path(test, "Y_test.txt"))

activityTraining <- read.table(file.path(train, "Y_train.txt"))

labelsTest  <- read.table(file.path(test, "X_test.txt" ),header = FALSE)

labelsTraining <- read.table(file.path(train, "X_train.txt"),header = FALSE)

features <- read.table(file.path("./data/unzipped/UCI HAR Dataset","features.txt"))

##INSPECT THE RELEVANT FILES
str(labelsTest)

str(labelsTraining)

str(features)

str(subjectTraining)

str(subjectTest)

str(activityTest)

str(activityTraining)

##COMBINE THE ROWS OF THE RELEVANT FILES
* subjectTest and subjectTraining have the same columns
* activityTest en activityTraining have the same columns
* featuresTest en featuresTraining havve the same columns
* so we can combine them by rbind

activityTotal <- rbind (activityTest, activityTraining)

subjectTotal <-rbind(subjectTest, subjectTraining)

labelsTotal <- rbind(labelsTest, labelsTraining)

##CHANGE THE COLUMN NAMES

names(subjectTotal) <- c("subject")

names(activityTotal)<- c("activity")

names(labelsTotal) <- features$V2

##COMBINE THE COLUMNS
nearlyDone <-cbind(labelsTotal,cbind(subjectTotal, activityTotal))

##FIND THE COLUMNS THAT ARE ABOUT MEAN OR STD
* see also: https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/37290_8e5a126a3a044b95881ae8df530da583.html)

subSetNames<-features$V2[grep("mean\\(\\)|std\\(\\)", features$V2)]

desiredColumnNames<-c(as.character(subSetNames), "subject", "activity" )

FinalSet<-subset(nearlyDone,select=desiredColumnNames)

##GET THE MEAN FOR EVERY SUBJECT AND EVERY ACTIVITY AND MAKE IT INTO A TIDY DATA SET
* see also: https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/37290_8e5a126a3a044b95881ae8df530da583.html)

FinalSetfinally<-aggregate(. ~subject + activity, FinalSet, mean)
FinalSetfinally<-FinalSetfinally[order(FinalSetfinally$subject,FinalSetfinally$activity),]
write.table(FinalSetfinally, file = "thisisthetidydata.txt",row.name=FALSE)
